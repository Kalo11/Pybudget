# Add Screenshots

Drop screenshots into this folder using these canonical names:
- `dashboard.png` (main dashboard view)
- `edit-entry.png` (edit dialog)
- `onboarding.png` (first-run onboarding)
- `recurring-rules.png` (left panel showing recurring rules list)

Optional modern UI captures:
- `budget-progress.png` (budget usage bar states)
- `entries-table-modern.png` (type chips + amount styling)

Capture tips:
- Use realistic sample data (income + expenses in different categories).
- Include the full topbar and stats row in `dashboard.png`.
- Ensure chart panels are visible in at least one screenshot.
- Use `390px` and desktop widths for optional responsive comparison shots.
